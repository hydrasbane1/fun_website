			<p> I have been trying to find a larp group for vampire the masqurade in the city I live in. Un-fortunately most of them are dead. It seems covid killed them all. Kinda ironic that the thing that killed the vampire larp scene (if there ever was one at all) was a virus that wouldnt effect vampires. the fact that playing immortal was killed by a worry over mortality. not that I think that the lockdowns and precautions were a bad thing after all its only playing immortal not being so.</p>
